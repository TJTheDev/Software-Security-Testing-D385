The question is about potential code injection attacks in Python and which Python function is prone to such attacks.

Code Injection Attacks:
A code injection attack is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker can insert and execute malicious code into a program or application. This can happen when user-supplied data is not properly validated or sanitized before being executed by the program. If an attacker can manipulate data that gets executed as code, they can potentially take control of the application, access sensitive information, or perform unauthorized actions.

Now, let's examine the answer options:

- **A. eval()**

This option is correct. The eval() function in Python is prone to code injection attacks because it takes a string as input and interprets it as Python code. In other words, it allows dynamic execution of arbitrary Python expressions. If untrusted data from a user or an external source is passed to eval() without proper validation, an attacker can inject malicious Python code that gets executed, leading to serious security risks. (**CORRECT**)

- **B. type()**

The type() function in Python is not directly related to code injection attacks. It is used to determine the type of an object, such as whether it's a list, dictionary, integer, etc.

- **C. print()**

The print() function in Python is not prone to code injection attacks. It is used to display output on the console or in files and does not execute arbitrary code.

- **D. append()**


The append() function is a list method in Python used to add elements to the end of a list. It is not related to code injection vulnerabilities as it deals with manipulating list data.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. eval(). This function is prone to potential code injection attacks because it interprets user-supplied data as executable code, making it a significant security risk if not used carefully and with proper input validation. As a general security best practice, it's important to avoid using eval() with untrusted data to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
