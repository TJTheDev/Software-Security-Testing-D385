The `response.content` method in a HTTP response object (often returned by HTTP client libraries like the `requests` library in Python) returns the raw binary content of the response. This content includes the data sent by the server as a response to the request.

However, if you are interested in detailed information about the response, including headers, status code, redirection history, and other metadata, the `response` object itself (without `.content`) provides this information. The correct method to obtain the status code from the response object is `response.status_code`.

Let's briefly explain the other options:

B. response.history: This attribute of a response object contains a list of response objects that were generated in handling the redirections. It's particularly useful when a series of redirects are followed.

C. response.status_code: This attribute of a response object contains the HTTP status code returned by the server. It's used to check whether the request was successful (e.g., 200 for "OK"), informational, or an error (e.g., 404 for "Not Found").

D. response.get: This is not a standard method in the `response` object. The `requests` library in Python does provide a `.get()` method to send a GET request, but it's used on the request side, not on the response side. It's used like `requests.get(url)` to send a GET request to the specified URL.

So, for receiving information about the server's response and its content in binary form, the correct option is A. `response.content`.

**A. response.content (CORRECT)**
