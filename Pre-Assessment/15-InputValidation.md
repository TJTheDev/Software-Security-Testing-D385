**A security analyst is reviewing code for improper input validation.**
 
## Which type of input validation does this code show?
 
isValidNumber = False 

while not isValidNumber:
 
try: 

- pickedNumber = int(input('Pick a number from 1 to 10')) 

- if pickedNumber >= 1 and pickedNumber <= 10: 

- isValidNumber = True 
 
except: 

- print('You must enter a valid number from 1 to 10') 

- print('You picked the number ' + str(pickedNumber)) 

 
A. Type and range check

B. Type and length check

C. Length and range check

D. Invalid number check

- This code snippet performs a type check by converting the input to an integer (int(input(...))), ensuring it's a valid integer. Additionally, it performs a range check by verifying that the picked number is within the specified range of 1 to 10. The code also handles invalid inputs by catching exceptions.

- The primary focus of the validation in this code is on checking both the type (integer) and the range (1 to 10) of the input. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

- **A. Type and range check (CORRECT)**
