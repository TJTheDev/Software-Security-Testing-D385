The primary defense against log injection attacks is to **sanitize outbound log messages**. Log injection is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates log messages to inject malicious code or exploit system vulnerabilities. By sanitizing outbound log messages, you ensure that any user-supplied input or potentially dangerous characters are properly escaped or removed before being included in the log.

Sanitizing log messages involves applying input validation and output encoding techniques to prevent the injection of malicious content. It typically involves validating the input data, such as user inputs, and sanitizing or encoding it appropriately to ensure it does not contain any harmful characters or constructs.

Some common techniques for sanitizing log messages include:

- **Input validation**: Validate and restrict user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain any unauthorized or dangerous characters.

- **Output encoding**: Encode the log messages in a way that prevents the interpretation of special characters or malicious constructs. For example, you can use HTML entity encoding, URL encoding, or database-specific encoding techniques, depending on the log storage and processing mechanisms.

By properly sanitizing outbound log messages, you can minimize the risk of log injection attacks and ensure that the logs remain a reliable and secure source of information for monitoring and analysis purposes.

#### It's important to note that the other options listed (B, C, and D) are not directly related to defending against log injection attacks:

- A. Sanitize outbound log messages (**CORRECT**)

- B. "Do not use parameterized stored procedures in the database" is not a specific defense against log injection attacks. However, using parameterized queries or stored procedures can help protect against SQL injection attacks, which are a different type of security vulnerability.

- C. "Allow all users to write to these logs" is not a recommended approach as it can lead to unauthorized or malicious log entries, making the logs less trustworthy and potentially susceptible to manipulation.

- D. "Use API calls to log actions" is a good practice for logging actions but does not directly address log injection attacks. It focuses on the method of logging rather than the specific defense against log injection vulnerabilities.

#### In summary, the best defense against log injection attacks is to **sanitize outbound log messages** by properly validating and encoding user-supplied data before including it in the logs.
