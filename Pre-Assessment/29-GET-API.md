**Consider the following API code snippet:**
 
import requests 
url = 'https://website.com/' 
 
 "# Get request"
 
result = requests.get(url) 
 
 "# Print request"
 
print(result.content.decode())

B. 200

C. 401

D. 400

Importing the requests library: The code begins by importing the requests library, which is a popular Python library used for making HTTP requests to web servers.

Setting the URL: The variable url is assigned the value 'https://website.com/', which is presumably the URL of some website or API endpoint.

Making a GET request: The code then makes a GET request to the URL using requests.get(url).

Storing the result: The result of the GET request is stored in the variable result. This variable will contain information about the response from the server, including the HTTP status code.

Printing the content: The code then attempts to print the content of the response using print(result.content.decode()). This assumes that the response content is in a format that can be decoded as text.

Now, let's analyze the potential HTTP status codes mentioned:

A. 403 (CORRECT): HTTP status code 403 means "Forbidden". This status code is returned by the server when the request is understood, but the server refuses to authorize it. This could be due to insufficient permissions or other access restrictions. If the server returns a 403 status code, it indicates that the client (your code) does not have the necessary permissions to access the resource at the given URL.

B. 200: HTTP status code 200 means "OK". This status code is returned when the request has been successfully processed by the server, and the server is returning the expected content. This would indicate that the request was successful without any access issues.

C. 401: HTTP status code 401 means "Unauthorized". This status code is typically used when the client (your code) needs to provide authentication credentials, such as a username and password, to access the resource. If the server returns a 401 status code, it means that the client's request lacks valid authentication credentials.

D. 400: HTTP status code 400 means "Bad Request". This status code is returned when the server cannot understand the request due to client error, such as malformed syntax or missing required parameters. If the server returns a 400 status code, it means the client's request was improperly formed.

Given the code snippet provided and assuming that the URL 'https://website.com/' corresponds to a resource that the client (your code) does not have permission to access, the correct status code is A. 403 (FORBIDDEN).

**A. 403 (CORRECT)**
