**Consider the following assertion statement:**
 
def authorizeAdmin(usr): 

   assert isinstance(usr, list) and usr != [], “No user found” 
    
   assert ‘admin’ in usr, “No admin found.” 
    
   print(“You are granted full access to the application.”) 
 
If __name__ == ‘__main__’: 

   authorizeAdmin([‘user’]) 
 
## What should be the response after running the code? 
 
A. AssertionError: No admin found

B. AssertionError: No user found 

C. Authorized User 

D. You are granted full access to the application

Let's analyze the code:

The authorizeAdmin function takes a single argument called usr.

The first assert statement checks two conditions:

It checks if usr is an instance of a list.
It checks if usr is not an empty list.
If either of these conditions is not met, the assertion raises an error with the message "No user found."
The second assert statement checks if the string 'admin' is present in the list usr. If this condition is not met, the assertion raises an error with the message "No admin found."

If both assert statements pass (meaning the conditions are satisfied), the code prints "You are granted full access to the application."

In the provided code, when the authorizeAdmin function is called with the argument [‘user’], it satisfies the first assert statement (because the argument is a non-empty list), but it fails the second assert statement because the string 'admin' is not present in the list.

As a result, the response after running the code will be:

**A. AssertionError: No admin found (CORRECT)**

This is because the second assert statement is not met, and it raises an assertion error with the message "No admin found."
