**Consider the following penetration test:**
 
import requests 
urls = open("websites.txt", "r") 
  
for url in urls: 
  - url = url.strip() 
  - req = requests.get(url) 
  - print (url, 'report')
 
  try: 
   - transport_security = req.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] 
   except: 
   - print ('HSTS header not set properly') 
 
## Which security vulnerability is shown? 
 
A. Man-in-the-middle 

B. Cross-site scripting 

C. Denial of service

D. Code injection

The provided code is checking for the presence of the "Strict-Transport-Security" (HSTS) header in the HTTP response from the websites listed in the "websites.txt" file. HSTS is a security feature that helps protect websites against man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that communication between the browser and the web server occurs over a secure HTTPS connection.

The code attempts to retrieve the HSTS header from the HTTP response headers. If the header is not set properly (indicating that HSTS is not being enforced), it prints a message indicating the vulnerability. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a type of attack where an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, and without proper HSTS implementation, an attacker could potentially perform a MITM attack by downgrading the connection from HTTPS to HTTP, leaving the user vulnerable to various security threats.

Therefore, the code is checking for the vulnerability related to man-in-the-middle attacks, making option A the correct answer.

The correct answer is:

**A. Man-in-the-middle (CORRECT)**
